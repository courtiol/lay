## An R package for simple but efficient rowwise jobs

### Why **{lay}**?

Implementing rowwise operations for tabular data is notoriously awkward in R.

Many options have been proposed, but they tend to be complicated, inefficient, or both.

Instead `lay()` -- the only function of the package **{lay}** -- aims at reaching a sweet spot between simplicity and efficiency.

The function `lay()` is intended to be used to apply a function on each row of a data frame or tibble, independently, and across multiple columns containing values of the same class (e.g. all numeric). 

The function has been specifically designed to be combined with functions from [**{dplyr}**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and to feel as if 
it was part of it (but you can use `lay()` without [**{dplyr}**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)).

There is hardly any code behind `lay()` (it can be coded in 3 lines), so this package may just be an interim solution before an established package fulfils the need... Time will tell.

### Installation

You can install a development version of **{lay}** with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("courtiol/lay")
```


### Motivation

Consider the following dataset, which contains information about the use of pain relievers for non medical purpose.
```{r motivation}
library(lay)  ## requires to have installed {lay}
drugs
```

The dataset is [tidy](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf): each row represents one individual and each variable forms a column.

Imagine now that you would like to know if each individual did use any of these pain relievers.

How would you proceed?


### Our solution: `lay()`

This is how you would achieve our goal using `lay()`:
```{r lay}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)  ## requires to have installed {dplyr}

drugs_full |>
  mutate(everused = lay(pick(-caseid), any))
```

We used `mutate()` from [**{dplyr}**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) to create a new column called *everused*, and we used `pick()` from that same package to remove the column *caseid* when laying down each row of the data and applying the function `any()`.

When combining `lay()` and [**{dplyr}**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), you should always use `pick()` or `across()`. The functions `pick()` and `across()` let you pick among many [selection helpers](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/language.html) from the package [**{tidyselect}**](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/), which makes it easy to specify which columns to consider.

Our function `lay()` is quite flexible! For example, you can pass argument(s) of the function you wish to apply rowwise (here `any()`):

```{r NA}
drugs_with_NA <- drugs     ## create a copy of the dataset
drugs_with_NA[1, 2] <- NA  ## introduce a missing value

drugs_with_NA |>
  mutate(everused = lay(pick(-caseid), any)) |> ## without additional argument
  slice(1)  ## keep first row only
  
drugs_with_NA |>
  mutate(everused = lay(pick(-caseid), any, na.rm = TRUE)) |>  ## with additional argument
  slice(1)
```

Since one of the backbones of `lay()` is  [**{rlang}**](https://rlang.r-lib.org), you can use the so-called [*lambda* syntax](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html) to define anonymous functions on the fly:

```{r lambda}
drugs_with_NA |>
 mutate(everused = lay(pick(-caseid), ~ any(.x, na.rm = TRUE))) ## same as above, different syntax
```

We can also apply many functions at once, as exemplified with another dataset:

```{r worldbank}
data("world_bank_pop", package = "tidyr")  ## requires to have installed {tidyr}

world_bank_pop |>
  filter(indicator == "SP.POP.TOTL") |>
  mutate(lay(pick(matches("\\d")),
             ~ tibble(min = min(.x), mean = mean(.x), max = max(.x))), .after = indicator)
```

Since the other backbone of `lay()` is [**{vctrs}**](https://vctrs.r-lib.org), the splicing happens automatically (unless the output of the call is used to create a named column). This is why, in the last chunk of code, three different columns (*min*, *mean* and *max*) where directly created.

**Important:** when using `lay()` the function you want to use for the rowwise job must output a scalar (vector of length 1), or a tibble or data frame with a single row.

We can apply a function that returns a vector of length > 1 by turning such vector into a tibble using `as_tibble_row()` from [**{tibble}**](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/):

```{r worldbank2}
world_bank_pop |>
  filter(indicator == "SP.POP.TOTL") |>
  mutate(lay(pick(matches("\\d")),
             ~ as_tibble_row(quantile(.x, na.rm = TRUE))), .after = indicator)
```


### Alternatives to `lay()`

Of course, there are many alternatives to perform rowwise jobs.

Let's now consider, in turns, these alternatives -- sticking to our example about drugs usage.


#### Alternative 1: vectorized solution

One solution is to simply do the following:
```{r vector}
drugs_full |>
  mutate(everused = codeine | hydrocd | methdon | morphin | oxycodp | tramadl | vicolor)
```
It is certainly very efficient from a computational point of view, but coding this way presents two main limitations:

  - you need to name all columns explicitly, which can be problematic when dealing with many columns
  - you are stuck with expressing your task with logical and arithmetic operators, which is not always sufficient

  
#### Alternative 2: 100% [**{dplyr}**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)

```{r dplyr}
drugs |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(everused = any(c_across(-caseid))) |>
  ungroup()
```
It is easy to use as `c_across()` turns its input into a vector and `rowwise()` implies that the
vector only represents one row at a time. Yet, for now it remains quite slow on large datasets (see **Efficiency** below).


#### Alternative 3: [**{tidyr}**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)

```{r, }
library(tidyr)  ## requires to have installed {tidyr}

drugs |>
  pivot_longer(-caseid) |>
  group_by(caseid) |>
  mutate(everused = any(value)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  pivot_wider() |>
  relocate(everused, .after = last_col())
```
Here the trick is to turn the rowwise problem into a column problem by pivoting the values and then
pivoting the results back. Many find that this involves a little too much intellectual gymnastic. It
is also not particularly efficient on large dataset both in terms of computation time and memory required
to pivot the tables.


#### Alternative 4: [**{purrr}**](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)

```{r purrr}
library(purrr)  ## requires to have installed {purrr}

drugs |>
  mutate(everused = pmap_lgl(pick(-caseid), ~ any(...)))
```
This is a perfectly fine solution and actually part of what one implementation of `lay()` relies on
(if `.method = "tidy"`), but from a user perspective it is a little too geeky-scary.


#### Alternative 5: [**{slider}**](https://slider.r-lib.org/)

```{r slider}
library(slider)   ## requires to have installed {slider}

drugs |>
  mutate(everused = slide_vec(pick(-caseid), any))
```
The package [**{slider}**](https://slider.r-lib.org/) is a powerful package which provides several *sliding window* functions.
It can be used to perform rowwise operations and is quite similar to **{lay}** in terms syntax.
It is however not as efficient as **{lay}** and I am not sure it supports the automatic splicing demonstrated above.


#### Alternative 6: [**{data.table}**](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/)

```{r data.table, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)  ## requires to have installed {data.table}

drugs_dt <- data.table(drugs)

drugs_dt[, ..I := .I]
drugs_dt[, everused := any(.SD), by = ..I, .SDcols = -"caseid"]
drugs_dt[, ..I := NULL]
as_tibble(drugs_dt)
```
This is a solution for those using [**{data.table}**](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/).
It is not particularly efficient, nor particularly easy to remember for those who do not program frequently using [**{data.table}**](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/).


#### Alternative 7: `apply()`

```{r apply}
drugs |>
  mutate(everused = apply(pick(-caseid), 1L, any))
```
This is the base R solution. Very efficient and actually part of the default method used in `lay()`.
Our implementation of `lay()` strips the need of defining the margin (the `1L` above) and benefits from
the automatic splicing and the lambda syntax as shown above.


#### Alternative 8: `for (i in ...) {...}`

```{r for}
drugs$everused <- NA

columns_in <- !colnames(drugs) %in% c("caseid", "everused")

for (i in seq_len(nrow(drugs))) {
  drugs$everused[i] <- any(drugs[i, columns_in])
}

drugs
```
This is another base R solution, which does not involve any external package. It is not very pretty,
nor particularly efficient.


#### Other alternatives?

There are probably other ways. If you think of a nice one, please leave an issue and we will add it here!


### Efficiency

Here are the results of a benchmark comparing alternative implementations for our simple rowwise job on
a larger dataset with `r ncol(drugs_full)` columns and `r nrow(drugs_full)` rows (see [benchmark](https://courtiol.github.io/lay/articles/benchmark.html) for details and more tests):

```{r bench_run1, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
rm(drugs)

drugs_full_dt <- data.table(drugs_full) ## coercion to data.table

benchmark1 <- bench::mark(
  vectorized = {
    drugs_full |>
      mutate(everused = codeine | hydrocd | methdon | morphin | oxycodp | tramadl | vicolor)},
  lay = {
    drugs_full |>
      select(-caseid) |>
      mutate(everused = lay(pick(everything()), any))},
  c_across = {
    drugs_full |>
      rowwise() |>
      mutate(everused = any(c_across(-caseid))) |>
      ungroup()},
  pivot_pivot = {
    drugs_full |>
      pivot_longer(-caseid) |>
      group_by(caseid) |>
      mutate(everused = any(value)) |>
      ungroup() |>
      pivot_wider()},
  pmap = {
    drugs_full |>
      mutate(everused = pmap_lgl(pick(-caseid), ~ any(...)))},
  slider = {
    drugs_full |>
      mutate(everused = slide_lgl(pick(-caseid), any))},
  data.table = {
    drugs_full_dt[, ..I := .I]
    drugs_full_dt[, everused := any(.SD), by = ..I, .SDcols = -"caseid"]},
  apply = {
    drugs_full |>
      mutate(everused = apply(pick(-caseid), 1, any))},
  'for' = {
    everused <- logical(nrow(drugs_full))
    columns_in <- colnames(drugs_full) != "caseid"
    for (i in seq_len(nrow(drugs_full))) everused[i] <- any(drugs_full[i, columns_in])},
  iterations = 5,
  time_unit = "ms",
  check = FALSE
  )
benchmark1 |>
  mutate(expression = forcats::fct_reorder(as.character(expression), median, .desc = TRUE)) |>
  plot()
```

Note that the x-axis of the plot is on a logarithmic scale.

As you can see, `lay()` is not just simple and powerful, it is also quite efficient!


### History

<img src="https://github.com/courtiol/lay/raw/main/.github/pics/lay_history.png" alt="lay_history" align="right" width="400">

The first draft of this package has been created by **@romainfrancois** as a reply to a tweet I posted under **@rdataberlin** in February 2020.
At the time I was exploring different ways to perform rowwise jobs in R and I was experimenting with various ideas on how to exploit 
the fact that the newly introduced function `across()` from [**{dplyr}**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) creates tibbles on which on can easily apply a function.
Romain came up with `lay()` as the better solution making good use of [**{rlang}**](https://rlang.r-lib.org/) & [**{vctrs}**](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/).

The verb `lay()` never made it to be integrated within [**{dplyr}**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and, so far, I still find `lay()` superior than
most alternatives, which is why I decided to maintain this package.

In short, I deserve little credit and instead you should feel free to buy Romain a coffee [here](https://ko-fi.com/romain) or to sponsor his [github profile](https://github.com/romainfrancois).
